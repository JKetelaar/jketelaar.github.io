I'm just another Application Developer.

### More Information

I am an Application Developer that loves to play with new programming languages, tools, and frameworks. You often find me working on open-source projects, such as [Parabot](https://github.com/Parabot) or my [own repositories](https://github.com/JKetelaar).

By trying to work with the most intuitive things in my free time and overengineering projects, I allow myself to build up enough knowledge to know what you should and shouldn't apply in a business project.
